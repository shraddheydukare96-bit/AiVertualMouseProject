# AiVertualMouseProject
The AI Virtual Mouse lets users control the computer cursor with hand gestures using a webcam. Built with Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI, it detects hand landmarks to perform actions like move, click, and scroll, offering a smart and touch-free alternative to a physical mouse.
